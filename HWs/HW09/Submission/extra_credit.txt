For extra credit, I have added a keyboard to the bottom of the game screen, and
added the function to have the letters that are guessed to change the keyboard key's
colors. I didn't just make the keyboard change the same color as the guessed letters,
but created a coloring priority for the keyboard in the order: unguessed, gray, yellow,
then green. Green keys don't get changed if they are then guessed yellow with the next
guess. Yellow only changes if it becomes green, etc.

I also added specific unicode for the enter and backspace keys.

Lastly, I added two .txt files, one kept the name words.txt and the other is named officially_allowed_guesses.txt
words.txt contains the possible words that can be guessed, and the second one contains all the "official words" 
from Wordle that can be used to guess the wordle. So both this words.txt and the officially_allowed_guesses.txt are
required to run Jordle.java.

Here is a list of all my required files to run the game:

Self-procured:

Thank you for TA'ing this semester.
